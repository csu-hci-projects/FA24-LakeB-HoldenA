This project was completed for Professor Ortega's CS310-H class at Colorado State University, Fall 2024.

The application is a simple Unreal Project which completes 10 tasks assigned to us. Those tasks were:

 1. Creating a VR Project
 2. Creating a level with static mesh objects and decorations
 3. Creating a teleportation area using a nav mesh.
 4. Adding at least 3 unique VR grab interactables
 5. Modify the Pistol blueprint to account for ammo and create a spatial ammo counter
 6. Add a delayed reload function to the pistol
 7. Add 5 targets to the level
 8. Create a blueprint that keeps track of the number of targets destroyed.
 9. Create an unlockable no-teleport area that updated when all targets were destroyed.
 10. Add a win level.

We also completed 2 more tasks:
 1. Modify the targets to move.
 2. Add a sectret room unlocked by an object being placed on a pedestal.

### Running the Project
To run the project within Unreal Engine 5.4.4, navigate to `\_HW2\Holden_Lake_HW2\Holden_Lake_HW2.uproject` and launch it in Unreal 5.4.4. Once launched, simply run the game in VR preview mode. 
*(VR preview mode required a VR HMD connected to the same computer in some way)*

To run the built project (may not work depending on your system), simply launch `Homework2.exe`.

### Roles:
- Alex Holden handled the level design and static meshes and materials for the levels.
- Brayden Lake handled all of the blueprints and coding as well as handling updating the Github to accommodate Homework 2.

### Group Meetings
We met up every class to catch up on what each other had done, but specific meetings included in-class activites.
|Meeting Date| Content |
|--|--|
| 12/02/2024 | We went over the progress of our project thusfar and covered any issues we had. We had another member, Everett, join us to complete his part of his group project as his group member was absent. |
| 12/04/2024 | We went over the progress of our project thusfar and covered any issues we had. We covered more pressing issues this time including plugins that weren't working with Github. Class ended up not happening, so we finished out our work and left once we had confirmation that the class was cancelled. |




## HW1
To play, simply launch the 'Homework1_HoldenLake' shortcut within the folder, or launch Homework1_HoldenLake.uproject and load the MainMenu level to start.

To launch a new deployment, find the 'Platforms' icon within the Homework1_HoldenLake.uproject file, Package and Cook the game in Windows, then under the 'Project Launcher' setting, choose the custom level and launch it. 
You'll then find the finished build through the shortcut or within the /Saved/StagedBuilds/Windows/ folder.

For this part of the project, Brayden Lake coded all the blueprints and levels while Alex created the models and level-design.

This game is built upon the Unreal FPS template.
We have added:
- An ammo system for the rifle
- A health system for the player.
- Health and ammo pickups.
- Targets with a health system.
- Hazards for the player that lower health.

This project was created for CS310H, Fall 2024.

## HW1
To play, simply launch the 'Homework1_HoldenLake' shortcut within the folder, or launch Homework1_HoldenLake.uproject and load the MainMenu level to start.

To launch a new deployment, find the 'Platforms' icon within the Homework1_HoldenLake.uproject file, Package and Cook the game in Windows, then under the 'Project Launcher' setting, choose the custom level and launch it. 
You'll then find the finished build through the shortcut or within the /Saved/StagedBuilds/Windows/ folder.

For this part of the project, Brayden Lake coded all the blueprints and levels while Alex created the models and level-design.

This game is built upon the Unreal FPS template.
We have added:
- An ammo system for the rifle
- A health system for the player.
- Health and ammo pickups.
- Targets with a health system.
- Hazards for the player that lower health.

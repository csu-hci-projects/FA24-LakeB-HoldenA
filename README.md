## HW1
This project was created for CS310H, Fall 2024.

To play, simply launch the 'Homework1_HoldenLake.uproject' file, load the MainMenu level to start.

For this part of the project, Brayden Lake coded all the blueprints and levels while Alex created the models and level-design.

This game is built upon the Unreal FPS template.
We have added:
- An ammo system for the rifle
- A health system for the player.
- Health and ammo pickups.
- Targets with a health system.
- Hazards for the player that lower health.
